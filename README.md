# My Web Component - Library
In this project, I will be defining my own, styled, animated and accessible components, like buttons, radio-buttons, forms, etc. 

They will be written in HTML, CSS, and where needed, adding JS/TS. My main focus for the components, are that they should be accessible and reusable, and easy to copy over to other projects I work on. 

### ToDO:
- [ ] Create a simple wireframe for the website
- [ ] Create a style-guide for the components, and define certain styles they should follow.
- [ ] Set up the main website 

- [ ] Buttons
- [ ] Radio-buttons
- [ ] Login-forms
